# Six Thinking Hats

Making the best decisions often requires looking at them through different lenses so that you don't overlook an important aspect. Six Thinking Hats, created by Edward de Bono, is a tool for doing exactly that. You can use it for your own thinking or in a group where everyone can represent a different perspective.

## How to use it
Each thinking hat represents one lens/perspective/style of thinking. Try "wearing" different hats and look at the decision through each.

If you're in a group, you can assign the hats to everyone to get a balanced discussion. Or you can go through different perspectives as a whole group.

Here's what each hat is about:

üü° Yellow hat is about positivity. Try seeing the benefits of this decision and what opportunities it opens.
üü¢ Green hat represents creativity. Let your mind run free and generate ideas without censoring them. Try coming up with creative options and solutions. Tools like the Productive Thinking Model or First Principles can help you.
üî¥ Red hat is about emotions. How do you feel about this? Use your intuition and gut feelings. Try to see how others might react emotionally. It's a great way to bring emotions into an otherwise rational process.
‚ö™Ô∏è White hat makes you focus on the data. Analyze the available data and trends. This represents a very rational approach.
‚ö´Ô∏è Black hat represents looking at the downside. What are the worst-case scenarios? Take a defensive approach, imagine any potentially negative outcomes, see what might not work. Inversion might be a helpful tool here.
üîµ Blue hat is for controlling the process. Especially in meetings, it's good to be able to step in when there's no progress and enable the group to move forward (e.g. by shifting the thinking or discussion to a different hat/perspective).
Illustration of the Six Thinking Hats: Yellow for positivity, Green for creativity, Red for emotions, White for data, Black for negativity and Blue for control.
Example
Let's see how using this tool might play out in an example scenario. Suppose you're in a management meeting to decide if you should introduce a new product to your portfolio to battle declining sales. You use the Six Thinking Hats tool to make sure the decision is considered from all possible angles.

Starting with the yellow hat, you discuss the sizable chunk of the market that this new product might cater to. It's a big opportunity for capturing a lot of revenue.

You switch to the black hat to look at possible downsides: what if the new product cannibalizes our existing products? What if it doesn't offer enough value for people to buy it?

A person wearing the white hat points out that the data you have about the market shows several unmet needs. It also shows that the declining sales of the existing products signal a trend that the market as a whole is moving to different solutions.

Wearing the yellow hat again, you see that the unmet needs in the market represent a solid opportunity and it's supported by data. Considering the possible downsides, you ask: How might we make sure the new product offers enough value?

You put on the green hat and generate ideas for how you might prototype the new product and test its value with people.

Because the meeting has been running for a while now, the facilitator wearing the blue hat suggests postponing the decision until the new product is validated with people.

The group decides to wear the red hat to do a check how everyone feels about this plan. People agree that it's a high-stakes decision and it feels right to lower the risk before making the decision. They're less anxious about it now.

In this example, the group arrived at a reasonable next step toward making this decision. Using the Six Thinking Hats, every perspective was heard and the outcome was made possible by discussing the different perspectives.

## Key takeaway
Six Thinking Hats is a tool that allows you to consider a decision or problem from different angles. It enables you to deliberately see aspects you might otherwise overlook, making your decision better and more resilient in the end.

# Second-order thinking

Some decisions seem like wins at first, but turn out to be losses over time. What seems like an investment now turns out to be a liability later. What looked like a good decision earlier is now a bad one. Second-order thinking is a tool that will help you examine the long-term effects of your decisions.

Most people stop at first-order thinking. Second-order thinking is necessary to make decisions that will stand the test of time. We need to make sure we're okay with more long-term consequences of our decisions today.

## How to use it?
Using second-order thinking can be a purely mental exercise or you can write it down on paper.

Consider a decision you have to make. Start by looking at the most immediate effects of making this decision ‚Äì the first order.

Then for each of the effect ask yourself: "And then what?" That's how you examine the second order of this decision's consequences. You can repeat this for as many orders as you find practical.

Alternatively, think about the decision in different timelines. Ask yourself: What will be the consequences of this decision in

10 minutes? 
10 months?
10 years?
This way you can think about the short-term, medium-term and long-term consequences of your decision.

You can apply second-order thinking on big decisions (e.g. buying a house), but also small, seemingly mundane, decisions (e.g. eating a cake). It's a very universal tool that is relevant not just in personal life, but also in business or policy-making.

Second-order thinking in practice
Let's explore what second-order thinking looks like in action. Consider the decision of buying a house outside of the city.

The immediate effects might be having a garden, more space for your family, but also suddenly living an hour away from work.

Now look at higher-order consequences of each:

having a garden ‚Üí able to grow your produce ‚Üí having fresh herbs and vegetables
more space for family ‚Üí more rooms to clean ‚Üí more stress from a messy home 
living an hour away from work ‚Üí need to buy a car ‚Üí spending two hours of each day in a car
Obviously, this is just a small subset of consequences for such a big decision, but it shows how second-order thinking can help you see the more long-term consequences. You can now make a more informed and thoughtful decision.

# Eisenhower Matrix

Named after U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, this prioritization framework will help you organize your tasks and activities by importance and urgency. It's especially useful when you're very busy but don't feel like what you do has much impact.

## How to use it
The Eisenhower Matrix has four quadrants along two axes: importance and urgency.
For every activity or task, ask yourself: It is important or not? Is it urgent or not?

Based on the answer, place the activity/task in the right quadrant. The quadrant determines what you should do with the task:

1. Important and urgent ‚Üí Do it
These are the tasks that you want to do as soon as possible. 
Crises, pressing problems and other things where not acting now has negative consequences.
2. Important but not urgent ‚Üí Schedule it
Find a time for these tasks and do them then.
This quadrant is typically where deep work happens ‚Äì tasks that contribute to your projects or long-term goals.
3. Urgent but not important ‚Üí Delegate it
If you can, find someone who can do these tasks for you.
If you can't delegate it, schedule it but always try to do the important-but-not-urgent tasks first.
These are often administrative tasks or things that have deadlines but aren't critical.
4. Not urgent and not important ‚Üí Don't do it
These tasks aren't worth your time and you shouldn't do them at all.
Avoidance activities, busy work and entertainment goes into this quadrant.
This is also the order of the priority of your tasks. Yes, important-but-not-urgent tasks come before urgent-but-not-important.

Eisenhower matrix is very flexible so it's up to you if you use it for professional tasks, personal ones or both.

You can also work with it on different timescales: planning your day vs. generally prioritizing activities in your life.

How do you tell urgent tasks from important ones?
Urgent tasks typically have a clear deadline (e.g. sending a draft to a client) or require you to react in a timely fashion (e.g. emails). Important tasks tend to be aligned with your long-term goals (e.g. exercising) and push your projects forward (e.g. writing code for your side project).

Determining urgency and importance will always depend on your context and your ability to recognize what's truly urgent and truly important.



## Takeaway
The promise of the Eisenhower Matrix is to make you more productive by setting the right priorities and acting on them. If you're always busy but don't get anywhere on your long-term projects and goals, this tool is definitely for you. But it's also a generally useful tool for deciding what to work on and what to eliminate from your life.



# Ladder of inference

Avoid jumping to conclusions. Make decisions based on reality.

We act and make decisions based on the conclusions we make. But we tend to jump to these conclusions and skip important parts of the reasoning process.

Ladder of inference, developed by a former Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is a tool that helps you fill the gaps in your thinking and make decisions based on reality. It's also helpful to challenge the thinking of others and reach better conclusions together.

## The ladder
There are 7 steps on the ladder that represent our mental processes. Here's what it looks like from the bottom up:

Available data
This is the reality we are able to observe.
Selected data
We select what we pay attention to based on our prior experiences and existing beliefs. We don't have the mental capacity to take in every piece of data available, so we have to make this selection.
Interpretations
We give facts meaning. We paraphrase what we see or hear to make sense of it.
Assumptions
Based on our interpretation, we make our own personal assumptions.
Conclusions
We draw conclusions from our assumptions.
Beliefs
Our beliefs are then developed from the conclusions we make.
Actions
Finally, we take actions that are rooted in what we believe to be true.
These processes usually happen unconsciously and very quickly in our brain. Applying this ladder consciously allows you to take a step back and see where you're jumping to conclusions.

## How to use it
Whenever you make a conclusion about something or are making decisions based on your conclusions, it's good to stop and question your reasoning.


First, identify on which step of the ladder you currently are. Are you about to take action and you're not sure if it's the right one? Or perhaps you're aware of some of the assumptions you're making?

Then work your way down before building your reasoning up again. To work your way down the ladder, use these guiding questions for each step:

Actions:
Why do I believe this to be the right action? What are some alternative options?
Beliefs:
What beliefs do I hold about this? What conclusions are they based on?
Conclusions:
Why did I conclude this? What are my assumptions there?
Assumptions:
Are my assumptions valid? Why am I assuming this? 
Interpretations:
Am I looking at this data objectively? What other meanings could they have?
Selected data:
What did I ignore or didn't pay attention to? Are there other sources of data I didn't consider?
As you answer these, you may find that your reasoning changes along the way and that's good. When you reach the bottom of the ladder, work your way back up again, this time more consciously and deliberately.

## Example
Let's see how applying the ladder of inference looks like on a practical example.

Suppose I'm managing a team of developers. One of them hasn't been performing well recently. He's been missing deadlines and several projects were delayed because of this. I conclude he's not cut out for the job and decide to fire him.

However, I stop and ask myself: Is this the right thing to do? I can now apply the ladder of inference to unpack my thinking and perhaps make a better decision. I ask myself the guiding questions:

Why do I believe that firing this person is the right action? Because it's clear to me he's not right for the job.
What conclusions is this belief based on? That he's not a good developer.
What are my assumptions here? I assumed that his recent results are representative of his qualities (or lack thereof).
Why am I assuming this? Because missed deadlines mean he's not efficient.
What other meanings could the data I'm looking at have? Missed deadlines might also mean the deadlines are unreasonable or he's taking extra time to deliver quality code.
Are there other sources of data I didn't consider? I haven't asked him directly yet. When I do, I might find out the real reason he's been missing deadlines.
This is a simplified example but it shows the kind of jumping to conclusions I want to avoid: missed deadlines ‚Üí inefficient ‚Üí not a good developer ‚Üí should be fired. By unpacking my thinking, I can look at the situation more objectively and I may discover different reasons for what's happening: perhaps the deadlines are too tight or he's going through some personal issues. Neither of which should be a reason to fire him.

The ladder of influence has just helped me avoid making a bad and premature decision.

# Cynefin framework

Make sense of different situations to choose an appropriate response.

Different situations typically require different responses. The Cynefin framework (pronounced /k…ôÀàn…õv…™n/ - "kuh-nev-in") is there to help you make sense of the situation in front of you and make a decision that's appropriate for the type of situation you're dealing with. It was developed by Dave Snowden in 1999. 

## How to use it
The framework identifies five domains to categorise problems or situations: clear, complicated, complex, chaotic and disorder.

The idea is to identify which domain you're in and then choose the appropriate action based on its characteristics. So let's look at each domain in detail.

Cynefin framework consisting of Complex, Complicated, Chaotic and Clear quadrants
### Clear
Also known as obvious or simple, this is the domain of best practices. This is where problems are familiar and clearly defined, cause-and-effect relationships are clear and the situations are stable. Many process-oriented situations and problems would fall into this domain. It's a domain of "known knowns".

Solutions are usually clear in these situations and don't require much expertise.  

The right approach would be sense‚Äìcategorise‚Äìrespond: understand the situation (sense), categorize it, then respond by applying a best-practice solution.

### Complicated
In this domain, there might be multiple right answers but aren't immediately visible. It's a domain of "known unknowns" ‚Äì when questions are clear but it takes work to answer them.

That's why the best approach is to sense-analyze-respond. Because analysis is needed, the situations here typically require expert knowledge. Experts should assess the situation, investigate possible options and choose a course of action.

### Complex
In this domain, there are "unknown unknowns". The situation cannot be understood by analysis because we don't yet know enough about it. It's not clear what needs to be answered in the first place.

So the right approach is to experiment first, learn about the problem. Then sense what you're dealing with and respond appropriately. The goal should be to understand enough so that the problem or situation moves to the complicated domain where it's easier to deal with.

### Chaotic
When things aren't under control, the situation falls into the chaotic domain. It's when cause and effect relationships are unclear. Here it's necessary to first act to establish some stability, to contain the situation. Only then assess the situation and work on bringing enough order to it to move it into the complex domain. Act‚Äìsense‚Äìrespond.

The chaotic domain also presents an opportunity to try novel solutions as people might be more open to them in this context.

### Disorder
If you don't know where you stand, you're in the disorder domain. The goal should be to quickly identify the right domain and move forward from there. It can be helpful to break down the problem or situation into multiple parts and assign each to a specific domain.

## Determining which domain you're in
It's best to get more familiar with each domain to learn when characteristics of a problem/situation apply to a particular domain. The sources below are a good place to start.

Here's a set of questions that can also help point you to the right domain:

Do you know what causes the situation?
Is the situation under control?
How much do you know about it?
Does solving it require expert knowledge?
Takeaway
The key idea of the Cynefin framework is that different kinds of situations or problems require different kinds of responses. You should identify what kind of a situation you're dealing with and‚Äîwith the help of this framework‚Äîchoose an appropriate response.

# Decision matrix

Choose the best option by considering multiple factors.

Some decisions can be tough to make. Especially when there are more factors that go into making them. Decision matrix is a tool that will help you consider all the important factors when making a decision. It brings more clarity into the process.

It is most useful when you have several options and you need to decide between them based on a number of different factors.

## How to use it 
Decision matrix is basically a simple table with your options and factors for deciding. The goal is to calculate a score for each option based on their factor scores. The score will help you make your decision.

Here's how to create a decision matrix step by step:

Write down the decision you need to make
List the options you have
Identify factors that you want to consider
Score the options on each factor
Add weight to the factors
Calculate the options' scores ‚Äì multiply each score by the factor weight, then add them up.
Pick your winner ‚Äì option with the highest score
Let's see how this works in practice.

## Practical example
Suppose you're leading a design team and you want to decide which design tool you want to use as a team. You've done some research and you narrowed down your options to three: Sketch, Figma and Framer. Let's put them in your decision matrix table.

Factors	TBD	TBD	TBD	Score
Weights	
Sketch	
Figma	
Framer	


Now let's look at the factors you need to consider. You have a set budget for tools so cost will be the first factor. After discussing with your team, you agree that prototyping and collaboration capabilities of a tool are most important for them. Now you have the factors that will influence the decision.

Factors	Cost	Prototyping	Collaboration	Score
Weights	



Sketch	



Figma	



Framer	



It's time to score each option on every factor. Let's use a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 is the worst, 5 is the best), but you can use any scale you like.

Cost ‚Äì You find out that Figma and Framer both cost $12/editor/month, while Sketch is a little cheaper at $9. You'll score them 3 and 4 respectively.

Prototyping ‚Äì Framer comes out as the most powerful in prototyping. Figma and Sketch are somewhat similar, but Figma can do a little more. Framer gets a 5, Figma a 3 and Sketch a 2.

Collaboration ‚Äì You let your team evaluate this one. They agree that Figma is the best for collaboration, scoring it with 5. Sketch and Framer both get a 3.

Let's see how these look like in your decision matrix:

Factors	Cost	Prototyping	Collaboration	Score
Weights	



Sketch	4	2	3	

Figma	3	3	5	

Framer	3	5	3	

At this point, the decision might be a little clearer, but all factors aren't equally important. You need to add weight to them. Since your budget is set, the cost factor is the most important, making it a 5. Your team says that prototyping is a little more important for them than collaboration features. You weight the factors accordingly:

Factors	Cost	Prototyping	Collaboration	Score

Weights	5	4	3	

Sketch	4	2	3	

Figma	3	3	5	

Framer	3	5	3	

The next step is multiplying the scores with the weight of each factor. Score on each factor then adds up to a final score for every option:

Factors	Cost	Prototyping	Collaboration	Score

Weights	5	4	3	

Sketch	4*5 = 20	2*4 = 8	3*3 = 9	37

Figma	3*5 = 15	3*4 = 12	5*3 = 15	42

Framer	3*5 = 15	5*4 = 20	3*3 = 9	44

And there you have it. You have a score for each option based on the factors that are important for you. In this case, Framer comes out as the winner.

Decision matrix is a very useful tool for situations like this. When there are multiple factors to consider, this tools removes the uncertainty and subjectivity from your decision-making. It allows you to clearly figure out which decision is the most reasonable to make.

App for the decision matrix
If you want to give this tool a shot, I recommend using an app called Ruminate. It provides everything you need to create a decision matrix and does all the calculations for you.

# Confidence determines speed vs. quality

Determine a trade-off between speed and quality when building products.

In product development, speed and quality are two important variables. Prioritizing one is typically at the expense of the other. This tool will help you make that trade-off.

## How to use it?
Your decision to prioritize speed or quality should be based on your confidence in:

importance of the problem you're solving
correctness of the solution to said problem
Before you start, make sure that your confidence is based on data instead of subjective views.

Illustration of how confidence in problem and solution determines whether to focus on speed or quality.
There are three basic outcomes:

Is your confidence in the problem importance low? Focus on speed.
Is your confidence in the problem and the solution high? Focus on quality.
Is your confidence in the problem importance high, but low in the solution? Balance both speed and quality.
Of course, confidence isn't a switch but rather a scale. Therefore your outcome will be also more nuanced.
