# Six Thinking Hats

Making the best decisions often requires looking at them through different lenses so that you don't overlook an important aspect. Six Thinking Hats, created by Edward de Bono, is a tool for doing exactly that. You can use it for your own thinking or in a group where everyone can represent a different perspective.

## How to use it
Each thinking hat represents one lens/perspective/style of thinking. Try "wearing" different hats and look at the decision through each.

If you're in a group, you can assign the hats to everyone to get a balanced discussion. Or you can go through different perspectives as a whole group.

Here's what each hat is about:

üü° Yellow hat is about positivity. Try seeing the benefits of this decision and what opportunities it opens.
üü¢ Green hat represents creativity. Let your mind run free and generate ideas without censoring them. Try coming up with creative options and solutions. Tools like the Productive Thinking Model or First Principles can help you.
üî¥ Red hat is about emotions. How do you feel about this? Use your intuition and gut feelings. Try to see how others might react emotionally. It's a great way to bring emotions into an otherwise rational process.
‚ö™Ô∏è White hat makes you focus on the data. Analyze the available data and trends. This represents a very rational approach.
‚ö´Ô∏è Black hat represents looking at the downside. What are the worst-case scenarios? Take a defensive approach, imagine any potentially negative outcomes, see what might not work. Inversion might be a helpful tool here.
üîµ Blue hat is for controlling the process. Especially in meetings, it's good to be able to step in when there's no progress and enable the group to move forward (e.g. by shifting the thinking or discussion to a different hat/perspective).

Example
Let's see how using this tool might play out in an example scenario. Suppose you're in a management meeting to decide if you should introduce a new product to your portfolio to battle declining sales. You use the Six Thinking Hats tool to make sure the decision is considered from all possible angles.

Starting with the yellow hat, you discuss the sizable chunk of the market that this new product might cater to. It's a big opportunity for capturing a lot of revenue.

You switch to the black hat to look at possible downsides: what if the new product cannibalizes our existing products? What if it doesn't offer enough value for people to buy it?

A person wearing the white hat points out that the data you have about the market shows several unmet needs. It also shows that the declining sales of the existing products signal a trend that the market as a whole is moving to different solutions.

Wearing the yellow hat again, you see that the unmet needs in the market represent a solid opportunity and it's supported by data. Considering the possible downsides, you ask: How might we make sure the new product offers enough value?

You put on the green hat and generate ideas for how you might prototype the new product and test its value with people.

Because the meeting has been running for a while now, the facilitator wearing the blue hat suggests postponing the decision until the new product is validated with people.

The group decides to wear the red hat to do a check how everyone feels about this plan. People agree that it's a high-stakes decision and it feels right to lower the risk before making the decision. They're less anxious about it now.

In this example, the group arrived at a reasonable next step toward making this decision. Using the Six Thinking Hats, every perspective was heard and the outcome was made possible by discussing the different perspectives.

## Key takeaway
Six Thinking Hats is a tool that allows you to consider a decision or problem from different angles. It enables you to deliberately see aspects you might otherwise overlook, making your decision better and more resilient in the end.

# Second-order thinking

Some decisions seem like wins at first, but turn out to be losses over time. What seems like an investment now turns out to be a liability later. What looked like a good decision earlier is now a bad one. Second-order thinking is a tool that will help you examine the long-term effects of your decisions.

Most people stop at first-order thinking. Second-order thinking is necessary to make decisions that will stand the test of time. We need to make sure we're okay with more long-term consequences of our decisions today.

## How to use it?
Using second-order thinking can be a purely mental exercise or you can write it down on paper.

Consider a decision you have to make. Start by looking at the most immediate effects of making this decision ‚Äì the first order.

Then for each of the effect ask yourself: "And then what?" That's how you examine the second order of this decision's consequences. You can repeat this for as many orders as you find practical.

Alternatively, think about the decision in different timelines. Ask yourself: What will be the consequences of this decision in

10 minutes? 
10 months?
10 years?
This way you can think about the short-term, medium-term and long-term consequences of your decision.

You can apply second-order thinking on big decisions (e.g. buying a house), but also small, seemingly mundane, decisions (e.g. eating a cake). It's a very universal tool that is relevant not just in personal life, but also in business or policy-making.

Second-order thinking in practice
Let's explore what second-order thinking looks like in action. Consider the decision of buying a house outside of the city.

The immediate effects might be having a garden, more space for your family, but also suddenly living an hour away from work.

Now look at higher-order consequences of each:

having a garden ‚Üí able to grow your produce ‚Üí having fresh herbs and vegetables
more space for family ‚Üí more rooms to clean ‚Üí more stress from a messy home 
living an hour away from work ‚Üí need to buy a car ‚Üí spending two hours of each day in a car
Obviously, this is just a small subset of consequences for such a big decision, but it shows how second-order thinking can help you see the more long-term consequences. You can now make a more informed and thoughtful decision.

# Eisenhower Matrix

Named after U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, this prioritization framework will help you organize your tasks and activities by importance and urgency. It's especially useful when you're very busy but don't feel like what you do has much impact.

## How to use it
The Eisenhower Matrix has four quadrants along two axes: importance and urgency.
For every activity or task, ask yourself: It is important or not? Is it urgent or not?

Based on the answer, place the activity/task in the right quadrant. The quadrant determines what you should do with the task:

1. Important and urgent ‚Üí Do it
These are the tasks that you want to do as soon as possible. 
Crises, pressing problems and other things where not acting now has negative consequences.
2. Important but not urgent ‚Üí Schedule it
Find a time for these tasks and do them then.
This quadrant is typically where deep work happens ‚Äì tasks that contribute to your projects or long-term goals.
3. Urgent but not important ‚Üí Delegate it
If you can, find someone who can do these tasks for you.
If you can't delegate it, schedule it but always try to do the important-but-not-urgent tasks first.
These are often administrative tasks or things that have deadlines but aren't critical.
4. Not urgent and not important ‚Üí Don't do it
These tasks aren't worth your time and you shouldn't do them at all.
Avoidance activities, busy work and entertainment goes into this quadrant.
This is also the order of the priority of your tasks. Yes, important-but-not-urgent tasks come before urgent-but-not-important.

Eisenhower matrix is very flexible so it's up to you if you use it for professional tasks, personal ones or both.

You can also work with it on different timescales: planning your day vs. generally prioritizing activities in your life.

How do you tell urgent tasks from important ones?
Urgent tasks typically have a clear deadline (e.g. sending a draft to a client) or require you to react in a timely fashion (e.g. emails). Important tasks tend to be aligned with your long-term goals (e.g. exercising) and push your projects forward (e.g. writing code for your side project).

Determining urgency and importance will always depend on your context and your ability to recognize what's truly urgent and truly important.



## Takeaway
The promise of the Eisenhower Matrix is to make you more productive by setting the right priorities and acting on them. If you're always busy but don't get anywhere on your long-term projects and goals, this tool is definitely for you. But it's also a generally useful tool for deciding what to work on and what to eliminate from your life.
