## The 4 Ps

Product: This is where you define your product or service. Product Managers must ensure to have the right type of product that is in demand for the market. So during the product development phase, you must do an extensive research on the life cycle of the product that they are creating. Describe the benefits, the use cases, the technology. You need to clearly articulate what you do offer and what you don’t offer. If this is not clear, then you may fall victim to “scope creep” where customers, partners and internal members will keep expanding the scope of what you had originally envision.

Price: This is where you define your pricing structure.  Pricing always shapes the perception of your product.  If a company is new to the market and has not made a name for themselves yet, it is unlikely that your target market will be willing to pay a high price. On the other hand, a low price usually means an inferior product in the customer's eyes as they compare your product to a competitor. There are many different price strategies. Price can be based on subscription only (pure Subscription base) or can have a monthly or yearly maintenance fee, it can decrease as the number of users goes up (Tier Pricing), can be free up to a certain number of users or a certain number of features usage (Freemium). Price can also change based on geographical territory. Price determinations will impact profit margins, supply, demand and marketing strategy. It is not easy to find the right amount for the right audience. Probably, the best way to start is simply responding to the following questions:

 How much did it cost to produce the product?
What is the customer's perceived value?
Will a slight price decrease could significantly increase your market share?
Can the current price keep up with the price of the product’s competitors?
 

Promotion: This describes your marketing strategy and it mainly influences brand recognition and sales. There are multiple ways to promote a product and the best strategy includes a little bit of all. For example, Advertising and Public relations are two types of communications. The first one is typically paid for, while the second is often free and includes  press releases, exhibitions, sponsorship deals, seminars, conferences, and events. Word of mouth is also a type of product promotion. It is an informal communication about the benefits of the product by satisfied customers and ordinary individuals. Each touch point must be supported by a well positioned brand to truly maximize return on investment.

Place: This should explain your distribution model. This comes with a deep understanding of your target market. Basically, you need to figure out how you’re going to get your product to customers and partners, your supplier to your warehouse and then to your customer.

## The 3 Cs

Company: You first need to know your company very well: define or learn the vision and the mission. The location. The logo. The organization and its culture. Finally the core product and value. A company needs to carefully evaluate both the short term and long term strategies to beat competition and have a sustainable competitive advantage.

Customers: Define your target audience. Deeply research the type of customer, their demographics, their spending power, their habits, and their needs. A common mistake that companies do is to consider the shareholders as their customers. Instead, the main focus should be on the customers as it is the customer who can improve the performance of the organization and can cause the failure of the organization.

Competitors: To be successful, you need to know your market and especially your competitors. You want to learn how they operate, what marketing tactics they use, who their partners are, what financial position they are, who their employees and customers are. You can learn for your competitors' mistakes, model what works for them, discover from them new market opportunities.



# SWOT Analysis

Internal factors:
- Strength 
- Weakness  (This is something to improvize, give next priority)
External factors:
- Oppurtunities (Take advantage of this and give top priority)
- Threats

# Hypothesis

Assumptions made which will end up positive

[user group] [have some problem] [define the goal to achieve] [some % ] [measurement] [over some period of time]


## Testing the hypotheses

[Problem] - Why? Why? Why? Reason?

Example:

Problem - Members not enrolling (enrollment decreased)
Ask Why?
- Not satisfied
- Didn't fullfill the needs - ask Why? [Look at the data on what missing]
- Didn't understand the value - Why? [Better display the details in website, Run campaigns to educate]
- Not needed now
- Not needed at all - Why? [Survey and understand when likely and what likely affects]
- Not easy - why? [A/B test user experience, how to navigate]
- Not relevant [Interview users about this and understand]
